**Control conditions** have been added to admit only valid transactions:
* It is impossible to withdraw more money than the ones currently on the account;

```
How to download... working on it
```
### Instructions
Compile the project from the terminal with:
```
make
```
The Makefile is responsible to manage the dependencies and will create the object files.
To clear the directory from this files between one make and another you can use:
```
make clean
```
After the execution of the compiled files
you will be direct to the login page.
Here the program will ask the card number and the pin of the user. It will then check if these are in the database and if they are correct.
The admin is able to login with a special account *(Card Number = 0000000000000000 Pin = 00000)*. This account is flagged by the *ID = 0*, giving a different men√π after the authentication.

The user login page gives the following options to the customers:

0. **Logout**: exit from the user account and go back to the login page;
1. **Balance**: prints the current user's balance;
2. **Movements**: prints a table with the movements of the account. It displays:  
  - Beneficiary: if the movement was a transfer to another user it contains its card number. If it was a withdraw or a deposit it contains "SELF";
  - Amount: amount of the movement;
  - Date: displays date and time of the movement;
  - Type: displays the nature of the movement;
3. **Withdraw**: dispenses banknotes and coins for the amount requested by the user;
4. **Deposit**: it is possible to deposit cheques or cash. If the cheque option is selected the number of it is requested. It is then saved in the database;
5. **Transfer**: there are two kinds of transfers permitted:
  - Internal: if the Card Number of the beneficiary is in the database it permits the automatic exchange between two users;
  - External: it requires the name of the external bank and it has to be approved. For this reason the movement is saved on the external.csv and will then be checked and eventually allowed by the admin.

The admin login has the following options:
0. **Logout**: exit from the user account and go back to the login page;
1. **Balance**: prints the current ATM's balance;
2. **Take Cash**: allows the admin to withdraw cash from the ATM;
3. **Add Cash**: allows the admin to deposit cash to the ATM;
4. **Account Management**: the admin is able to enter customer's account by indicating the Card Number in order to fix problems or check movements;
